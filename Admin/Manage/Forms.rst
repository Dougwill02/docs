Creating and Using Forms
------------------------

A great way to customize the help desk to suit your unique use case is to add custom fields to either a built-in form for each ticket created from the Client Portal or internal tickets opened by agents. Included in the Help Desk are Built-In Forms and the ability to create Custom Forms.


Custom Forms
------------

Custom Forms allow you to create a variety of answer fields which are all customizable. Fields can be listed as internal- to be utilized by staff for internal ticket creation or when editing an existing ticket; or required for when the user submits a ticket. These Custom Forms can then be added to Help Topics to help improve workflow by capturing any required information from the user when submitting a ticket.

To assign a Custom Form to a **Help Topic**, go to Admin Panel > Manage > Help Topics > and select desired help topic. In the Forms Tab of the selected Help Topic, choose custom form from the drop down to be added when clients or staff are creating a new ticket. Multiple Custom Forms can be added to each Help Topic but only one of each Custom Form.

Custom Forms can also be amended to a ticket, a user profile or an Organization by utilizing the “More” quick button on the top right corner.


Built-In Forms
--------------

These forms are included on each new ticket that is created by client or staff; regardless of Help Topic selected. Currently, the software ships with Contact Information, Ticket Details, Task Details, Organization Information, and Company Information as Built-in Forms which are included on each new ticket created. We suggest you preview these built-in forms to see the information contained in them. All can be edited to further work with your company’s workflow. Fields which are marked “Required” will show in bold on the ticket form.

  **Contact Information:** This is the information associated with users in your help desk. This information will not be visible along the ticket header- only with the user’s profile if you click on their name on the ticket header. You can also view and edit this information in the User Directory.

  **Company Information:** This is referring to your Help Desk company information and can be pulled into email templates, signatures, or canned responses utilizing the variables.

  **Organizational Information:** You can expand the information you include when creating Organizations in your User Directory. This information will only be visible internally by your Help Desk Agents when they are reviewing the information associated with the Organizations.

  **Ticket Details:** The information in these fields are collected on each ticket created when Users go to your Client Portal and click “Open a New Ticket” or when tickets are created internally by Agents. These fields can be deemed required and/or internal.

  **Task Details:** The information in these fields are collected on each ticket created when Users go to your Client Portal and click “Open a New Ticket” or when tickets are created internally by Agents. These fields can be deemed required and/or internal.
